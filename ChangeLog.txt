rti_python ChangeLog

rti_python - 2.2.0
 - Added netCDF exporter
 - Added PD0 outputs for ensemble data

rti_python - 2.1.6
 - Added check for exterme tilts in check_binary_file.
 - In EarthVelocity, make sure both velocity and bottom track velocity are good when removing vessel speed.

rti_python - 2.1.5
 - Added a function in BinaryCodec to monitor the buffer size

rti_python - 2.1.4
 - Added average_mag_dir in EarthVelocity.

rti_python - 2.1.3
 - Added watchdog.py

rti_python - 2.1.2
 - Added qa_qc to Utilities to screen data
 - Changed Water Direction back to 0 - 360 degrees
 - Fixed bug in AdcpCommands:print_pretty_m for values greater than 1000m.
 - In config.py, added option to replace the Pressure Height in AutoWaves with Vertical Beam Height
 - In WaveForceCodec, add the option to replace the Pressure Height with Vertical Beam Height
 - Added Bin Size and Blank to AverageWaterColumn.
 - Added static method in Ensemble to create a dataframe from 2D array like velocity or amp or corr
 - In AncillaryDataSet, added is_upward_facing().
 - Added a main to read_binary_file to help understand how to use it.
 - In BinaryCodec, append the new data to the buffer instead of replace the new data.  Could prevent lost data.
